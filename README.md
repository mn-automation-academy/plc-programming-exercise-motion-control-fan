# Fan Control Exercise for CoDeSys with SoftMotion

This repository contains an exercise to help you gain confidence with Continuous Movements using PLCOpen Function Blocks in CoDeSys.

**What you will learn:**

* Implementing continuous motion control in CoDeSys.
* Using PLCOpen function blocks for motion control.
* Controlling a simulated industrial application (a fan).
* Understanding the basics of motion control.

**Prerequisites:**

* **CoDeSys V3.5 SP19 Patch 5 (3.5.19.50) or later installed.**
* **CoDeSys SoftMotion installed and licensed.** This exercise requires the SoftMotion functionality to be present in your CoDeSys installation.
* Basic familiarity with the CoDeSys IDE.

**How to Run:**

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project file (likely a `.project` or `.cmp` file) in CoDeSys.
3.  **Enable Simulation Mode:** In CoDeSys, go to the "Online" menu and select "Simulation". Ensure the simulation mode is active.
4.  Run the simulation. You should now be able to control the simulated fan.

**Getting Started:**

The project provides a basic framework to implement fan control using continuous motion. Examine the PLC program and focus on understanding how the PLCOpen function blocks are used to achieve the desired fan behavior.

**Further Exploration:**

You can extend this exercise by:

* Adding different speed profiles.
* Implementing error handling.
* Adding more complex control scenarios.

**Contributing:**

Contributions to improve this exercise are welcome.
